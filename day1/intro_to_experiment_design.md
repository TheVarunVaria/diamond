**Topic: Introduction to Experiment Design**

### Key Concepts:

* **Experiment**: A scientific study in which researchers manipulate one or more variables to observe the effect on another variable.
* **Explanatory variable**: The variable manipulated by the researcher (also called independent variable).
* **Response variable**: The variable that is measured and observed (also called dependent variable).
* **Control group**: A group that is not exposed to the experimental manipulation, used for comparison.
* **Treatment group**: A group that is exposed to the experimental manipulation.
* **Randomization**: Assigning subjects to groups randomly to reduce bias and ensure the groups are comparable.
* **Replication**: Repeating an experiment multiple times to increase confidence in the results.

## Types of Experiment Designs:

* **Completely randomized design**: Subjects are randomly assigned to either the control or treatment group.
* **Blocked design**: Subjects are first divided into blocks based on a relevant factor (e.g., age, gender) and then randomly assigned to the treatment within each block.
* **Matched-pairs design**: Subjects are paired based on a relevant factor, and then one member of each pair is randomly assigned to the treatment group.

## Principles of Good Experiment Design:

* Control for extraneous variables: Identify and control for any variables other than the explanatory variable that might affect the response variable.
* Randomize subjects to groups: This ensures that the groups are comparable and reduces bias.
* Replicate the experiment: Repeating the experiment increases confidence in the results and helps to ensure that the observed effect is not due to chance.
* Blind the experiment: This means that the subjects and/or researchers do not know which group they are in, which can reduce bias.
* Use an appropriate sample size: The sample size should be large enough to detect a real effect, but not so large that it is wasteful of resources.

## Benefits of Experiment Design:

* Helps to identify cause-and-effect relationships.
* Provides evidence to support or refute hypotheses.
* Allows researchers to control for extraneous variables.
* Increases the validity of research findings.

## Limitations of Experiment Design:

* Can be expensive and time-consuming.
* May not be ethical or feasible to conduct experiments in all situations.
* Results may not be generalizable to all populations.
